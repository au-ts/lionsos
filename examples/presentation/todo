## Presentation demo

On the MaaXBoard, I need to have:
* Debian or some kind of other distro booting that has
  console, network, and block access.
* Therefore, I also need a block driver, network driver,
  and serial driver all hooked up to the VMM that manages
  the distro.

The great thing is, we can do the exact same stuff with
QEMU.

DONE: 1. Reproduce simple VMM system in LionsOS
DONE: 2. Reproduce SDF with sdfgen
3. Add virtIO to VM
    DONE: 3.1: virtIO console instead of passthrough UART
    DONE: 3.2: virtIO block
    DONE: 3.3: virtIO networking

### Getting it working on MaaXBoard

DONE: 1. Native Linux with the Ubuntu/Debian image
2. Full passthrough with the Linux VM
3. Move to part native, part Linux VM

## Microkit sdfgen improvements
* Remove 'shared_resources' and 'page_size' from config.json
