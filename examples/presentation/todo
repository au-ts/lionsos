## Presentation demo

On the MaaXBoard, I need to have:
* Debian or some kind of other distro booting that has
  console, network, and block access.
* Therefore, I also need a block driver, network driver,
  and serial driver all hooked up to the VMM that manages
  the distro.

The great thing is, we can do the exact same stuff with
QEMU.

DONE: 1. Reproduce simple VMM system in LionsOS
DONE: 2. Reproduce SDF with sdfgen
3. Add virtIO to VM
    DONE: 3.1: virtIO console instead of passthrough UART
    DONE: 3.2: virtIO block
    DONE: 3.3: virtIO networking

### Getting it working on MaaXBoard

Now the MaaXboard works with virtIO console, block and networking. Now we
need to move to using a proper distro.

Need to understand how distros boot. We have some initrd that is on the block
device I guess? So what we want to do is put the distro image on `/dev/vda`.

## Microkit sdfgen improvements
* Need to handle unused memory regions
* Need to handle `<0x302d0000 0x10000>;` vs `<0x0 0x302d0000 0x0 0x10000>;`
* Need to be able to do passthrough VM access without manually specicfying and instead by using what
  is enabled in the DTS with "status = okay"
