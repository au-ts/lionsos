# Firewall Docker Testing Environment

The [Dockerfile](/examples/firewall/docker/Dockerfile) and
[scripts](/examples/firewall/docker/scripts/) contained in this directory allow
you to build a ubuntu docker container with the correct network infrastructure
to test the firewall, with the firewall itself running on qemu inside the
container.

Further building and testing information can be found on the lionsos
[website](https://https://lionsos.org/docs/examples/firewall/).
