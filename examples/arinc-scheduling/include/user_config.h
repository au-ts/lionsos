// @kwinter: I'm not sure whats easier for the HAMR folk, to auto gen a header file such as this or use the metaprogram
// in some way. If they are using any semi-modern version of the sDDF, they will have to use the metaprogram there to
// generate the config structs the timer requires. 
// 
// Is forcing the user of microkit_sdf_gen another annoying layer of abstraction?
