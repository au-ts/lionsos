# The Lions Operating System

This is the source code for LionsOS, an operating system based on the
seL4 microkernel using the seL4 Microkit.

LionsOS is aimed at embedded, IoT and cyberphysical systems and is designed to
be formally verifiable, adaptable to a wide class of use cases in the target
domain, while at the same time setting the benchmark for performance of
microkernel-based operating systems. We aim to achieve all three goals by a
highly modular yet ruthlessly performance-oriented design and strict adherence
to the time-honoured KISS principle.

For documentation on LionsOS and the reference example system, see the
[LionsOS website](https://lionsos.org).
